<p>In everyday English, “berry” is a term for any small edible fruit. These “berries” are usually juicy, round, brightly coloured, sweet or sour, and do not have a stone or pit, although many seeds may be present.</p>

<q>We should all do what, in the long run, gives us joy, even if it is only picking grapes or sorting the laundry.</q>
— E. B. White
